Over 98% of these occurred in low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2009, there were 42&#8197;013 neonatal deaths in Kenya,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and as child mortality falls, the proportion of under-5 mortality due to neonatal deaths is rising. The most recent estimates indicate that 60% of infant deaths and 40% of all under-5 deaths occurred in the neonatal period,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with this high neonatal mortality being a major reason why Kenya is not on track to achieve its fourth Millennium Development Goal target. The Ministry of Health has, therefore, started to prioritise interventions and investments to promote newborn (and maternal) health,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> basing its strategy on the essential newborn care package, including a number of low-cost, high-impact interventions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In Kenya, health workers receive limited preservice instruction on neonatal care in their basic training, gaining most practical experience during clinical placements or internship in hospitals recognised as &#8216;internship training centres&#8217;. The knowledge and skills gained in such centres will likely therefore determine whether essential neonatal interventions are effectively delivered at a national scale. Unfortunately, a previous study on a small number of Kenyan public hospitals suggested significant problems in provision of neonatal services.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, in a partnership with Kenya's Ministry of Health, an assessment of neonatal care services provided by internship training centres was undertaken to identify areas requiring improvement as part of wider efforts to improve newborn and child survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Indicators</title><p>Indicators were based on prior work identifying national and international priorities<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and adapted from previous studies in Kenyan hospitals.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> They focused on the Donabedian domains of structure (resources) and process.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For structure, we checked for availability of core resources (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2014306423TB1">table 1</xref>) and if a recommended standard admission record form (newborn admission record, NAR) was in use. For process, we audited documentation of three key symptoms and eight key clinical signs of severe illness that are prioritised nationally,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as they are associated with requirement for hospitalisation or referral.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Dosages of prescribed antibiotics (as recorded on the treatment sheets) at admission were compared against those recommended in national guidelines. A margin of error of 20% above (overdose) and below (underdose) recommendations was allowed. Prescriptions of intravenous fluids and feeds were assessed in the same manner. Evidence of monitoring of vital signs, weight and fluids was defined as the presence of a chart(s) in which these were recorded at intervals.

The hospitals included were purposefully selected by the Ministry of Health to complement additional evaluation exercises, to ensure reasonable regional representation and with a sample size fixed at 22 sites because of budgetary constraints. Process of care was assessed by examining case records of admissions to the hospital area designated as the &#8216;newborn unit&#8217;. The number of cases per hospital was calculated to enable reporting of an observed proportion of 50% correct care across all hospitals with a precision (95% CI) of &#177;5%. To achieve this, assuming a coefficient of variation of 0.2 to account for clustering,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we aimed to retrieve 60 case records per facility. Records were identified from the register of admissions starting from 31 May 2012 and going back through the register until 60 records were retrieved ensuring selection of records of those who had already been discharged or died.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection was done over 4&#8197;weeks in July 2012. Survey staff comprised 22 Ministry of Health employees (nurses, records officers or clinical officers) with one drawn from each selected hospital.

Staff were subsequently divided into five teams (4&#8211;5 per team) that each visited 4&#8211;5 hospitals for 3&#8211;4&#8197;days.</p><p>Resource availability was assessed by walking through the neonatal units using a standard checklist.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Availability was classified as universal (available in all 22 hospitals), mostly available (17&#8211;21), moderate (11&#8211;16) and low availability (0&#8211;10). Process of care and outcome data were entered directly into laptops using a data capture tool specifically designed for the survey in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, a secure web-based application designed for research studies).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A handbook of standard operating procedures was used in training and by all teams to guide all data entry.</p><p>Data were examined for errors in real time (in REDCap) and at the end of each day using STATA V.12 check files. Corrections were made by referring back to the source document under the supervision of the team leader. The clean data files from all sites were then uploaded into a central server.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Availability of resources is presented as frequencies (and percentages) across the 22 hospitals. For process indicators, results are descriptive and where proportions were computed, the 95% CIs are adjusted for clustering at hospital level. Summary scores of symptoms and signs were constructed by allocating a score of 0 or 1 to each symptom or sign documented and summing these scores for each case record. We computed a median score and IQR for each hospital. To summarise across hospitals, the median of these median scores with the range across the 22 hospitals is reported.

Although KMC is recommended for stable babies in national guidelines as it may reduce mortality and risk of sepsis and hypothermia,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> its implementation requires significant resources, including staff time. These resources are often not available likely explaining the challenges hospitals face in translating this policy into practice.</p><p>Resource limitations undermine the provision of basic neonatal care although there is improvement compared with a previous local survey.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In that survey, half the hospitals did not offer phototherapy and less than half had phenorbabitone injection.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similar concerns have also been noted in Tanzania and Ghana,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Central Asia and Eastern Europe<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and Bangladesh.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, the specific nature of resource challenges differs across place underscoring the need for local knowledge such as from this survey to help plan improvement efforts.</p><p>Patient records provide a means to document and communicate information about patients and their care.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> They are also a vital source of data on workload, morbidity and mortality. Previous works on quality of neonatal care in Kenya and other countries have been severely limited by poor availability of records.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We retrieved a total of 1249 records but in some sites faced difficulties identifying admission records. Indeed, in four hospitals, no records of deaths were found raising the possibility that our results are affected by a form of response (or retrieval) bias. Such missing data undermine accurate reporting of patient characteristics and outcomes at scale. Despite this, our data remain the best current description of quality of routine neonatal service delivery for a country with over 1.25 million births per year.</p><p>Of concern is that almost 20% of gentamicin prescriptions were for an overdose and most were in preterm/low birthweight newborns with doses &lt;50% above that recommended. Gentamicin is potentially ototoxic and nephrotoxic,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and drug level monitoring is not possible in any of the hospitals surveyed. Considerable variation in errors across hospitals is of great interest; for instance, the range of penicillin and gentamicin overdoses was 0%&#8211;100% and 1.9%&#8211;66.7%, respectively. Although standard guidelines are now more widely available in Kenya than previously,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> guidelines by themselves are insufficient to change practice. Thus, although there is evidence that neonatal prescribing is improving,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> additional interventions that include regular assessment of quality of care may be required to promote good practices among early career clinicians at scale.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The data available on outcomes are limited by missing data on birth weight, sex and particularly gestation. Available data suggest that many deaths occur early in admission and indicate very high case fatality in the extremely low birthweight babies; this may be a reflection of the lack of resources for more advanced care. However, the largest number of deaths occurred in normal weight births, suggesting significant opportunities to improve outcomes through improved basic perinatal and neonatal care. Better routine data in future may allow for analysis of the effect of quality of care on outcomes.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>These results may not be representative of all hospital care for neonates in Kenya. Data are cross-sectional, from internship centres and based on observation of resources and record retrieval and review. Clinical practice in these hospitals is supervised by a paediatrician and thus may overestimate quality of care if results are generalised to the many hospitals with no paediatrician. In addition, we focused only on aspects of quality of care directly linked to implementation of guidelines. However, these are the most comprehensive data until now on routine neonatal care in a low-income African country.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This audit shows improvement in the availability of basic resources and routine clinical practices. However, errors in prescribing and provision of supportive care and poor data remain a challenge undermining practice and health service monitoring. These data may indicate that such problems are more widespread in the region and we argue for specific efforts to promote quality care and monitor service delivery at scale as part of efforts to reduce newborn mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the director of medical services in the Ministry of Health who gave permission for conducting the study in the government hospitals, the medical superintendents of the hospitals for providing access and all the research assistants and hospital staff who were essential to data collection.
