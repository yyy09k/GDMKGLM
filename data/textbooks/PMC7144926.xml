Here, we report a novel function for MORC2 in cell-cycle checkpoint control through an acetylation-dependent mechanism. MORC2 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase NAT10 at lysine 767 (K767Ac) and this process is counteracted by the deacetylase SIRT2 under unperturbed conditions. DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation stimulate MORC2 K767Ac through enhancing the interaction between MORC2 and NAT10. Notably, acetylated MORC2 binds to histone H3 phosphorylation at threonine 11 (H3T11P) and is essential for DNA damage-induced reduction of H3T11P and transcriptional repression of its downstream target genes <italic toggle="yes">CDK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cyclin B1</italic>, thus contributing to DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint activation. Chemical inhibition or depletion of NAT10 or expression of an acetylation-defective MORC2 (K767R) forces cells to pass through G2 checkpoint, resulting in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, MORC2 acetylation levels are associated with elevated NAT10 expression in clinical breast tumor samples. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for MORC2 in regulating DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint through NAT10-mediated acetylation and provide a potential therapeutic strategy to sensitize breast cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy by targeting NAT10.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81372847</award-id><award-id>81572584</award-id><award-id>81772805</award-id><award-id>81972461</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100012166</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC0908400</award-id><award-id>2018YFE0201600</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100013285</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-06</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">10.13039/501100003399</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16JC1405400</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The DNA damage response plays a central role in the onset of human cancer and tumor responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A common cellular response to genotoxic stress is activation of a cell cycle checkpoint, which blocks cell-cycle progression and allows time to repair DNA lesions before cells reenter the normal cell cycle (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Eukaryotic cells have three major DNA damage checkpoints, including the G1/S, intra-S-phase, and G2/M checkpoints (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The G1/S checkpoint is mainly propagated through the activation of the p53 pathway. As the p53 gene is frequently mutated or silenced in human cancer (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), most cancer cells have a dysfunctional G1/S checkpoint and therefore depend on the S and G2/M checkpoints for survival in response to genotoxic stress (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The intra-S phase checkpoint serves to address both DNA replication errors and DNA damage incurred during S phase, which is controlled by the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR)/checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) signaling (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The G2/M checkpoint restricts mitosis onset in response to genotoxic stress, and its deregulation allows cells with damaged DNA to proceed into the mitosis phase, leading to chromosome instability that is linked to tumorigenesis, mitotic catastrophe, or cell death (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and its interactor Cyclin B1 are key regulators for the G2/M transition and mitotic progression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). When DNA damage occurs in late S or the G2 phase, the CDK1/Cyclin B1 complex is inactivated, at either transcriptional or posttranslational level, to arrest cells at the G2/M transition (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that DNA damage rapidly reduces histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3T11P), a novel chromatin mark for transcriptional activation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), through activating protein phosphatase 1&#947; (PP1&#947;) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) or releasing CHK1 kinase from chromatin (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Decreased H3T11P contributes to transcriptional repression of CDK1 and Cyclin B1 through reducing histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9 (H3K9Ac) at their promoters in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although the basic framework of cell-cycle checkpoints in eukaryotic cells has been outlined, it remains to identify new players that regulate this complex network.</p><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes are key players in all DNA-templated reactions in eukaryotes, and their deregulation is intimately implicated in various human diseases including cancer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). One such key enzyme is the MORC family CW-type zinc finger 2 (MORC2), a member of the highly conserved microrchidia (MORC) family of ATPases (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#8211;17</xref>). Being a characteristic of MORC proteins, MORC2 contains an N-terminal catalytically active ATPase module and a central CW-type zinc finger (CW-ZF) domain (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The ATPase module of MORC2 is composed of a gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase, and MutL (GHKL) domain and a S5-fold domain (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and its ATPase activity is critical for epigenetic gene silencing (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and DNA damage repair (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Notably, mutations in the ATPase module of MORC2 have been mechanistically linked to hereditary Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#8211;25</xref>) and triple-negative breast cancer (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The CW-ZF domain is structurally similar to the plant homeo domain (PHD) finger and acts as a histone recognition module for trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in multiple chromatin-associated proteins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#8211;29</xref>). Strikingly, MORC2 is unable to bind to H3K4me3 mark due to the absence of an aromatic cage in its CW-ZF domain (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), indicating that MORC2 engages with chromatin <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> distinct mechanisms. In addition, MORC2 contains a unique C-terminal chromo-like domain that is absent in other MORCs and four dispersed coiled-coil domains (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but their biological functions remain uncharacterized. Recent studies from our laboratory and others indicate that MORC2 is frequently overexpressed in multiple types of human cancer and acts as a driver of oncogenesis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#8211;35</xref>). In addition, we recently demonstrated that MORC2 is a DNA damage-responsive protein with an emerging role in DNA repair (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, its functional and mechanistic role in cell-cycle checkpoint control remains unexplored.</p><p>Emerging evidence shows that lysine acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins acts as a key player in cellular response to DNA damage (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Protein acetylation is controlled by the concerted action of lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs), which catalyze the addition and removal of acetyl groups on lysine residues, respectively (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). To date, 22 KATs and 18 KDACs have been identified in human genome (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). According to their structure and catalytic mechanism, KATs can be grouped into three major families, including GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT), CBP/p300, and MYST, while KDACs are classified into two distinct families, including Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylases (HDAC1-11) and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuin deacetylases (SIRT1-7) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is a member of the GNAT family of KATs and has been documented to acetylate RNA (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40&#8211;42</xref>), transcriptional factor p53 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), transcriptional cofactor Che-1 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and &#945;-tubulin (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Moreover, deregulation of NAT10 has been implicated in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46&#8211;48</xref>) and several types of human cancer (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49&#8211;51</xref>). More recently, we demonstrated that NAT10 acetylates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a key DNA repair protein, and is a potential binding partner for MORC2 (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, whether MORC2 is a novel substrate of NAT10 remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we report that NAT10 directly acetylates MORC2 at the conserved lysine 767 (K767Ac), which is antagonized by SIRT2 under unstressed conditions. Moreover, MORC2 K767Ac is stimulated by DNA-damaging agents in a NAT10, but not SIRT2, dependent manner, and is critical for G2 checkpoint arrest through transcriptional repression of H3T11P-mediated CDK1 and Cyclin B1. Consequently, chemical inhibition or depletion of NAT10 or expression of an acetylation-deficient mutant MORC2 results in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging therapeutic agents. These findings establish the importance and regulatory mechanism of MORC2 acetylation in governing DNA damage checkpoint signaling and therapeutic resistance, and motivate the combined use of NAT10 inhibitor Remodelin and conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy to optimize clinical outcome of patients with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell cultures and treatments</title><p>Human breast cancer MCF-7 (#SCSP-531), T47D (#TCHu 87), BT549 (#TCHu 93) cell lines and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell line (#SCSP-502) were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), and were authenticated by detection of mycoplasma, DNA-fingerprinting, and cell vitality.

To verify these results, we substituted the five lysine (K) resides with nonacetylable arginine (R) individually and examined their acetylation status in the presence or absence of NAM. Results showed that the K767R mutation significantly reduced NAM-induced upregulation of MORC2 acetylation compared to its wild-type (WT) counterpart and other four substitution mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>).

Toward this aim, WT cells and MORC2 KO MCF-7 and BT549 cells stably expressing pMSCV, Flag-MORC2, or Flag-MORC2 K767R were treated with or without 10 Gy IR alone or in combination with 500 ng/ml nocodazole, a widely used cell cycle synchronizing agent to induce mitotic arrest.

Validation of the NAT10 (Abcam, ab194297) antibody for IHC staining is available online from the manufacturers. We found that anti-MORC2 K767Ac antibody could detect strong signals in paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues that were specifically blocked by the acetyl-K767 antigen peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>), demonstrating that this antibody is suitable for IHC staining.

In this study, we uncovered several interesting findings concerning the regulation and functions of NAT10-mediated MORC2 acetylation in DNA damage checkpoint activation and resistance to DNA-damaging therapeutic agents in breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10H</xref>).</p><p>First, we identify lysine acetylation as a novel PTM of MORC2, which is oppositely regulated by the acetyltransferase NAT10 and the deacetylase SIRT2. Emerging evidence shows that MORC2 is a key player in tumorigenesis and tumor progression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31&#8211;35</xref>) and that mutations in MORC2 are present in hereditary Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22&#8211;25</xref>) and in cancer patients (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), highlighting the emerging importance of MORC2 in human diseases. However, how MORC2 is regulated still remains a gross mystery. In this study, we showed that MORC2 is an acetylated protein and is a novel substrate of NAT10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Furthermore, a positive correlation between NAT10 and MORC2 K767Ac levels was observed in clinical breast tumor samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). SIRT2 was originally identified as a cytoplasmic KDAC responsible for &#945;-tubulin acetylation (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that it can shuttle to the nucleus to target nuclear proteins for acetylation, such as p300 (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>) and histone H3 (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). We demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of SIRT2, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, decreased MORC2 K767Ac. Conversely, treatment with SIRT inhibitor NAM or depletion of SIRT2 increased MORC2 K767Ac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results establish SIRT2 as a deacetylase for MORC2 deacetylation.</p><p>Second, DNA-damaging agents stimulate MORC2 K767Ac in a NAT10 dependent manner. Execution of the DDR relies upon dynamic protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, PARylation, and acetylation, which have taken center stage as important DDR regulators (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and IR stimulate MORC2 K767Ac, and this process depends on NAT10. In addition, we recently demonstrated that MORC2 is modified by phosphorylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in response to DNA damage (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, whether there is a crosstalk among these PTMs of MORC2 during DDR remains to be addressed in the near future.</p><p>Third, acetylated MORC2 is required for the activation of the G2 checkpoint, thus contributing to enhanced cell survival following DNA damage. Recent studies have shown that DNA damage rapidly reduces H3T11P, and DNA damage-induced dephosphorylation of H3T11P contributes to subsequent transcriptional repression of <italic toggle="yes">CDK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cyclin B1</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In this study, we discovered that MORC2 K767Ac binds to H3T11P and is required for DNA damage-induced reduction of H3T11P and transcriptional repression of <italic toggle="yes">CDK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Cyclin B1</italic> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Consequently, acetylated MORC2 contributes to G2 DNA damage checkpoint activation (Supplementary S5-S7). Furthermore, chemical inhibition or depletion of NAT10 or expression of an acetylation-deficient mutant MORC2 sensitizes breast cancer cells to MMS and IR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In agreement with our findings, NAT10 has recently been shown to promote resistance to doxorubicin in liver and breast cancer cells by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Thus, we provide new mechanism by which NAT10 contributes to resistance to MMS and IR through regulating MORC2 acetylation and G2 DNA damage checkpoint activation. Together, these results suggest that MORC2 K767Ac can function as a mediator for DDR signals to activate the G2 checkpoint, thus maintaining genome integrity and facilitating cell survival after exposure to DNA-damaging agents.</p><p>In summary, findings presented here uncover a previously unrecognized function and regulatory mechanism for MORC2 by lysine acetylation in regulating cell-cycle progression and resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10H</xref>). As the NAT10 chemical inhibitor Remodelin has been characterized (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), it is conceivable that Remodelin might be a promising drug for sensitizing breast cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>gkaa130_Supplemental_File</label><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="gkaa130_supplemental_file.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Hai-Xin Yuan (Fudan MCB laboratory, Shanghai) for kindly providing HA-SIRT1 and HA-SIRT2 plasmids, and acknowledge the staff members of Institute of Radiation Medicine at Fudan University for technical assistance in IR treatment.
