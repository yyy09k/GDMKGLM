Self-care interventions are known to \nprevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations. This systematic review aimed \nto investigate whether self-care interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes among \nwomen with previous gestational diabetes.\nDATA SOURCES: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, \nand PsycINFO was conducted on December 2nd, 2024.\nSTUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised, cluster-randomised, and non-randomised \ncontrolled trials that compared the effects of self-care interventions with \nstandard/usual care or no intervention for preventing type 2 diabetes among \nwomen with previous gestational diabetes were included. The primary outcomes \nwere the incidence of type 2 diabetes, the composite incidence of any type of \ndiabetes, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose level two \nhours after the oral glucose tolerance test, and body weight.\nSTUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Risk of bias for included studies was \nassessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB2), or the Risk of Bias In \nNon-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I). Random effects models \nwere employed for meta-analyses. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using \nthe Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) \napproach.\nRESULTS: The search identified 35 trials including 6624 women. Only one \nrandomised trial (n=1601) reported the incidence of type 2 diabetes, indicating \nthat the lifestyle intervention focusing on diet and physical activity may have \nlittle to no effect (hazard ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.22], \nlow certainty of evidence). The effects of self-care interventions on the other \nprimary outcomes - composite incidence of any type of diabetes (three trials), \nglycated haemoglobin (three trials), fasting blood glucose (11 trials), blood \nglucose level two hours after the oral glucose tolerance test (six trials), and \nbody weight (18 trials) were uncertain (very low certainty of evidence). \nDowngrading of the certainty of evidence was predominantly due to high risk of \nbias, imprecision, and inconsistency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Available evidence on the effect of self-care interventions for the \nprevention of type 2 diabetes among women with previous gestational diabetes is \ninsufficient to draw strong conclusions, necessitating further research.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).
