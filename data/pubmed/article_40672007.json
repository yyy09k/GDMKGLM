GDM poses significant risks to both neonatal and maternal \nhealth, including fetal overgrowth, birth complications, and long-term metabolic \ndisorders. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GDM on neonatal birth \nweight and maternal postpartum metabolic changes. The primary objective was to \nassess the incidence of macrosomia and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births in \npregnancies complicated by GDM. Secondary objectives included evaluating \npostpartum glycemic and lipid profiles, comparing metabolic parameters at six \nweeks and six months between GDM and non-GDM groups, and identifying predictive \nand moderating variables such as glycemic control, pre-pregnancy BMI, and \ngestational weight gain.\nMETHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort study was conducted over an 18-month period \n(October 2023 to April 2025) at Health Net Hospital, a tertiary care and \nreferral center located in Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 219 pregnant women \nwere initially screened for eligibility. Following the application of inclusion \nand exclusion criteria, 189 women were enrolled, 94 diagnosed with GDM and 95 \nwithout GDM, serving as matched controls. Data were collected at three time \npoints: during the second trimester (baseline), at delivery, and during \npostpartum follow-up at six weeks and six months. Maternal metabolic markers, \nincluding glycemic and lipid profiles, were assessed longitudinally, while \nneonatal outcomes such as birth weight, NICU admission, and hypoglycemia were \ndocumented at birth. Follow-up adherence was ensured through scheduled reminders \nand flexible appointment rescheduling. Clinical and laboratory data were \ncollected using standardized protocols by trained staff. Logistic regression \nanalysis was used to identify independent predictors of adverse maternal and \nneonatal outcomes, with adjustments for potential confounders. Data analysis was \nperformed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0.2.0 (IBM Corp., \nArmonk, New York, United States).\nRESULTS: Neonates of GDM mothers had significantly higher birth weights (mean \n3689 g vs. 3143 g; p<0.0001), with increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia \nin 16 (17%) GDM cases compared to four (4.2%) non-GDM cases and NICU admissions \nin 19 (20.2%) GDM neonates versus five (5.3%) non-GDM neonates. GDM mothers \nexhibited elevated fasting glucose at six weeks (mean 98.5 mg/dL) and six months \n(94.1 mg/dL) postpartum, compared to non-GDM mothers (85.3 mg/dL and 83.2 mg/dL, \nrespectively; p<0.0001). Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance \n(HOMA-IR) and triglyceride levels were also significantly higher in the GDM \ngroup. GDM (OR=2.8), higher pre-pregnancy BMI, and poor glycemic control (HbA1c \n>5.9%) were independent predictors of neonatal macrosomia and maternal insulin \nresistance.\nCONCLUSION: GDM significantly increases the risk of macrosomia, neonatal \ncomplications, and sustained maternal metabolic dysfunction postpartum. These \nfindings underscore the importance of early diagnosis, effective glycemic \ncontrol, and structured postpartum follow-up to mitigate long-term risks.\n\nCopyright © 2025, Khan et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.86060\nPMCID: PMC12263459\nPMID: 40672007\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.
