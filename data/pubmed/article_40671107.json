This study aims to investigate the association and \nunderlying pathways between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and the subsequent \ndevelopment of type 2 diabetes in women with prior GDM, and to help identify \nhigh-risk populations.\nMETHODS: The sample included 788 participants from the National Health and \nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018. Multivariate logistic \nregression was utilized to examine the correlation of DII with diabetes and \nadiposity indices, such as body mass index (BMI) and relative fat mass (RFM) in \nparticipants with prior GDM. Mediation analysis was conducted to examine the \neffects of adiposity indices as potential mediators between DII and diabetes. \nSpearman correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between \nthe 26 dietary components of the DII on adiposity indices and the occurrence of \ndiabetes in participants with prior GDM.\nRESULTS: Among participants with prior GDM, higher DII scores were associated \nwith the occurrence of diabetes after variable adjustment. Mediation analysis \ndisclosed that adiposity indices mediated a substantial portion of the \nrelationship between DII and diabetes, with BMI (12.19%) and RFM (11.84%) \nshowing significant mediating effects. Spearman correlation analysis indicated \nthat different dietary components exhibited varying degrees of correlation with \nadiposity indices and diabetes among participants with prior GDM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher DII scores were associated with the occurrence of diabetes \nin women with prior GDM, partly mediated by adiposity indices, emphasizing the \nrole of diet in diabetes risk. Additionally, the findings suggested that these \nadiposity indices should be more broadly utilized to improve early diabetes \nprevention and treatment strategies among women with prior GDM.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.\n\nÂ© 2025.
