Wen School of Population and Public Health, University of California \nIrvine, Irvine, CA.\n(3)School of Family and Consumer Sciences, Texas State University, San Marcos, \nTexas.\n(4)Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health, University of Colorado \nAnschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study examined the association between diagnosis of depressive \ndisorder, the number of bad mental health days per month, and diabetes \nmanagement behaviors among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults with \ndiabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the Behavioral Risk Factor \nSurveillance System (2018-2021), including 2,272 self-identified non-Hispanic \nAI/AN adults diagnosed with non-gestational diabetes. Key variables included a \nself-reported prior diagnosis of depressive disorder and the number of bad \nmental health days in the past month. Outcome variables were seven diabetes \nmanagement behaviors, such as taking a diabetes management class and performing \ndaily foot checks. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, \nchi-squared tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Among the participants, 24.8% were diagnosed with depressive disorder, \nand 19.5% reported at least 14 bad mental health days in the past month. \nLogistic regression models show that those reporting depressive disorders were \nsignificantly less likely to check their feet daily (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = \n0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.92). Individuals with at least 14 bad mental health days \nwere significantly less likely to have ever taken a diabetes management class \n(AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36-0.99) and check their feet daily (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI: \n0.21-0.65) than those reporting no bad mental health days.\nCONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders and frequent bad mental health days were \nassociated with lower odds of diabetes management behaviors among AI/AN adults. \nThese findings suggest that enhancing mental health support within diabetes \nmanagement programs may help address disparities in diabetes care among AI/AN \nadults.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Wang et al.
