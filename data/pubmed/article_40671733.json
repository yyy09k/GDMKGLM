While technically classed as type 1 \ndiabetes, LADA is distinct from type 1 and 2 diabetes because of its \nintermediate progression that may or may not lead to complete insulin \ndependence. Differentiation is made with the presence or absence of \nautoantibodies and C-peptide. This is demonstrated in the following case. A \n29-year-old Black female with a history of gestational diabetes and two-year \nhistory of prediabetes was ultimately diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with an A1c \nof 6.6% and was treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily. Her blood glucose \nsuddenly rose to > 400 mg/dL and A1c to 8.6% after 8 months of therapy. Her BMI \nwas 22.45 kg/m2. Her provider ordered a C-peptide which measured 1.3 ng/mL \n(normal 0.8-5.2 ng/mL). Since this was technically normal, the provider \ncontinued with the type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Recognizing the C-peptide was \nlow-normal, the clinical pharmacist ordered autoantibody tests, discovering a \npositive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) > 250 IU/mL \n(normal < 0.0-5.0 IU/mL) and confirming the diagnosis of LADA. The pharmacist \ndiscontinued metformin and initiated a basal/bolus insulin regimen with \ntitration. Autoantibody testing is crucial to determine the proper diagnosis \nwhen the C-peptide is low-normal and should be prioritized. Recognition of the \nsigns of LADA and proper diagnostic testing can lead to earlier optimal \ntreatment and prevention of diabetes complications.\n\n© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical \nSciences 2025.
