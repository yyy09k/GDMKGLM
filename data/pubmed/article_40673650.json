GDM \nscreening followed a two-step approach: a 50-g 1-h oral glucose challenge test \n(OGCT), followed by a 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using \nCarpenter-Coustan criteria. Data included age, socioeconomic status (SES), \nresults of OGCT and OGTT tests, child birth weight, and gestational age. The \ndataset was linked to the Israeli National Diabetes Registry to identify \npostpartum DM. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) for GDM \nand postpartum DM, adjusting for maternal age, SES, ethnicity, and glucose \ntolerance status.\nRESULTS: Among 128,454 women, 10% were unscreened. Of those screened, 23,451 \nunderwent the full OGTT. GDM prevalence was 4.3%. Postpartum DM incidence was \n8.6% in women with GDM, 3.1% with unknown GDM status, and 2.1% with impaired \nglucose tolerance (IGT) (defined as one abnormal value on the OGTT). Compared \nwith normoglycemia, adjusted ORs for the 5-year postpartum DM were 25.48 (95% \nCI: 21.80-29.79) for GDM, 10.04 (95% CI: 8.59-11.74) for unknown GDM status, \n6.48 (95% CI: 5.07-8.28) for IGT, and 2.17 (95% CI: 1.63-2.88) for abnormal OGCT \nwith normal OGTT. Older age, lower SES, and Arab or Bedouin ethnicity were \nlinked to higher GDM and postpartum DM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gestational glucose intolerance and screening gaps were strong \npredictors of postpartum DM. Age, SES, and ethnicity highlight the need for \ntargeted efforts to reduce health disparities.\n\nÂ© 2025 The Author(s).
