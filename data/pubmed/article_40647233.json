We aim \nto explore the crosstalk between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and YOT2D \nin female offspring. Methods: In vivo, GDM mice were induced by Western diet \n(WD), and their female offspring were fed normal diet or WD within 3 to 8 weeks. \nWe continuously detected the glucose metabolism disorders, serum estradiol level \n(ELISA), and the process of ovarian maturation. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes \nin ERα and insulin signal in liver were monitored (qPCR, Western blot). In \nvitro, LO2 cells were treated with estradiol or ER antagonist BHPI to further \nexplore the mechanism. Results: More than 85% of pregnant mice induced by WD \nwere GDM models. The serum estradiol level in GDM offspring mice was decreased \nduring sexual maturation, accompanied by marked oral glucose intolerance, \ninsulin resistance, and even diabetes. The advance of sexual maturation and the \ndecrease in serum estradiol in GDM offspring were mainly due to the \ndownregulation of CYP19A1 in the ovaries, the reduced area of secondary \nfollicles, and the increased number of atresia follicles, which could be greatly \nworsened by WD. Furthermore, GDM suppressed the protein levels of ERα, p-IRS-1, \nand p-Akt in liver tissue, that is, estrogen signals and insulin signaling were \nsimultaneously weakened. WD further exacerbated the above changes. In vitro, \nestradiol upregulated the protein levels of ERα, p-IRS-1, and p-Akt in LO2 \ncells, while BHPI inhibited these changes. Conclusions: Maternal GDM promotes a \nhigh incidence of YOT2D in female offspring by affecting ovarian maturation, and \na high-calorie diet exacerbates this process.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu17132128\nPMCID: PMC12251584\nPMID: 40647233 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.",
