Objectives This study aims to evaluate and compare maternal and \nneonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, GDM, and the \ncoexistence of both conditions. Methods This retrospective observational study \nincluded 230 pregnant women who delivered at Shalamar Hospital, Lahore, \nPakistan, between January 2023 and December 2024. The participants were divided \ninto three groups: preeclampsia only (n = 80), GDM only (n = 75), and both \nconditions (n = 75). Results The coexistence of preeclampsia and GDM was \nassociated with the highest rates of cesarean section (82.7%, n = 62), preterm \nbirth (46.7%, n = 35), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (49.3%, n = \n37), and neonatal hypoglycemia (18.7%, n = 14). Maternal complications, \nincluding intensive care unit (ICU) admission (10.7%, n = 8) and postpartum \nhemorrhage (9.3%, n = 7), were also more frequent in this group. Logistic \nregression confirmed that combined preeclampsia and GDM independently predicted \nadverse outcomes such as cesarean delivery (odds ratio {OR}: 2.4), NICU \nadmission (OR: 2.1), and preterm birth (OR: 1.9). Conclusion It is concluded \nthat the co-occurrence of preeclampsia and GDM significantly worsens both \nmaternal and neonatal outcomes compared to either condition alone. Early \ndiagnosis, multidisciplinary management, and targeted interventions are crucial \nto mitigating these risks and improving perinatal care.\n\nCopyright © 2025, Umer et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.86120\nPMCID: PMC12265387\nPMID: 40672040\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.
