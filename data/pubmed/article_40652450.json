Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to \nand during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that \npreconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, \nreduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy \noutcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy \noutcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize \nprenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve \nthat goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. \nThe increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the \nimportance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing \nmedications during prenatal care for PDM.\nOBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that \nlead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.\nMETHODS: The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary \npanel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and \nsystematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant \nquestions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and \nafter pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \nevaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment \noptions, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with \ndiabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related \nto these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, \nDevelopment, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty \nof evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives \nfrom 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and \nresources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity \nof the proposed recommendations.\nRESULTS: In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of \nbecoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy \nintention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for \npregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when \nclinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence \ndemonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated \nhemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.In \nindividuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming \npregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | \n⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, \nwhere PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically \nsignificant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate \nof congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general \npopulation regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy \nterminations with the use of contraception.In individuals with T2DM, we suggest \ndiscontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before \nconception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the \nend of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data \non risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.In pregnant \nindividuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of \nmetformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the \nbenefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for \ngestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the \nrisk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related \nto changes in body composition.In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a \ncarbohydrate-restricted diet (<175 g/day) or usual diet (>175 g/day) during \npregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the \navailable evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant \nuncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was \ninsufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate \nintake cutoff of 175 g/day.In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either \nthe use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood \nglucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting \nsuperiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect \nevidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals \nwith T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes \nfor individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for \ndecreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals \nwith T2DM.In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a \nsingle 24-hour CGM target <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care \npregnancy glucose targets of fasting <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial \n<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | \n⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse \npregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L).In individuals \nwith T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump \n(pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM \n(without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). \nThis was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated \nimprovement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to \n11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use \nof hybrid closed-loop pump technology.In individuals with PDM, we suggest early \ndelivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). \nThis was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits \nof expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment \ncriteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.In individuals with PDM \n(including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum \nendocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | \n⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was \nsuggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between \nPCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital \nmalformations.\nCONCLUSION: The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low \ncertainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high \ncertainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, \nduring, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is \ncrucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM \nand their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and \nrefinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to \nsignificant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on \noptimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research \non timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.\n\nThis article has been co-published with permission in European Journal of \nEndocrinology and The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism © The \nAuthor(s) 2025.
