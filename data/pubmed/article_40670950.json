The female participants \nwere categorized into three groups: non-diabetes, DM, and GDM. Multivariate \nlogistic and linear regression models were employed to assess the correlations \nbetween periodontal variables and diabetes status. Additionally, a mediation \nanalysis was performed to explore the role of systemic inflammatory biomarkers.\nRESULTS: Compared to non-periodontitis, women with periodontitis have a 1.68 \ntimes higher risk of having GDM (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.14-2.50). Clinical \nattachment level (CAL), the continuous periodontal parameter, also presented a \nsignificant association with GDM risk (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25-1.81 per 1-mm \nincrease). Linear regression analyses further revealed that hemoglobin A1c \n(HbA1c) levels were positively associated with periodontitis (Beta = 0.19, \nSE = 0.06, p < 0.01) and CAL (Beta = 0.06, SE = 0.03, p < 0.001), respectively. \nThe association between periodontitis and GDM risk was found to be mediated by \nwhite blood cell count (WBC), monocyte count, and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio \n(MLR), with mediation proportions of 5.02%, 5.88%, and 5.20%, respectively. \nSimilar mediation effects were observed for the CAL-GDM association.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that periodontitis was associated with \nGDM among women of childbearing age, with systemic inflammation potentially \nserving as a partial mediator of this association.\n\n© 2025.
