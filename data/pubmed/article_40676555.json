Reduced Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF) and elevated \nGlycosylated Fibronectin (GlyFn) levels reflect these pathological changes. \nCombining these biomarkers into a ratio may enhance PE prediction in high-risk \npregnancies.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the GlyFn/PlGF ratio measured at 20-28 weeks of gestation \nas a predictor of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies across four hospitals in \nWest Java, Indonesia, from April-October 2024.\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study involved 54 high-risk pregnant women. The \nGlyFn/PlGF ratio was analyzed at 20-28 weeks to assess predictive accuracy for \nPE.\nRESULTS: Significant differences were noted between PE and non-PE groups in \npre-pregnancy weight (65.54 ± 12.69 vs. 58.53 ± 7.85 kg), BMI (45.52 ± 53.73 vs. \n19.84 ± 2.97), and systolic blood pressure (153.50 ± 19.42 vs. 100.80 ± 15.38 \nmmHg) (P > 0.05). Risk factors such as prior PE (P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus \n(P = 0.03), and gestational hypertension (P = 0.02) were more frequent in the PE \ngroup. A GlyFn cutoff of 34.31 ng/mL showed a 2.5-fold increased PE risk \n(sensitivity: 83.33%, specificity: 66.67%, AUC: 0.8071). A PlGF cutoff of 26.72 \npg/mL was associated with a 6.8-fold increased risk (sensitivity: 72.22%, \nspecificity: 97.22%, AUC: 0.9147). The GlyFn/PlGF ratio cutoff of 1.288 \nindicated a 28-fold higher PE risk (sensitivity: 77.78%, specificity: 97.37%, \nAUC: 0.9244).\nCONCLUSION: The GlyFn/PlGF ratio outperforms individual biomarkers in predicting \npreeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies, offering a valuable tool for early risk \nidentification and timely intervention.\n\n© 2025.
