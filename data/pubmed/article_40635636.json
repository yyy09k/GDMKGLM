This prospective \ncase-control study was performed at a tertiary university hospital. The study \ncohort comprised GDM patients with controlled blood glucose levels and a healthy \ncontrol group. Acceleration time/ejection time (At/Et) of the main pulmonary \nartery, right pulmonary artery, and left pulmonary artery Doppler parameters \nwere assessed and contrasted between the two groups. The study comprised 90 \npatients, with 30 in the gestational diabetes mellitus group focused on blood \nsugar regulation and 60 in the healthy control group. No statistically \nsignificant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the common \nmain pulmonary artery At/Et (p = 0.465), right pulmonary artery At/Et \n(p = 0.237), and left pulmonary artery At/Et (p = 0.283). No statistically \nsignificant difference was noted between the two groups regarding APGAR scores \nand blood gas parameters of the newborns (p < 0.05). No statistically \nsignificant difference was observed in fetal pulmonary artery Doppler parameters \n(p < 0.05) when gestational diabetes mellitus cases were classified based on the \nutilization of diet and insulin for blood sugar regulation. The pulmonary artery \nDoppler parameters in fetuses of pregnant women with gestational diabetes \nmellitus and controlled blood sugar levels are comparable to those of healthy \ncontrols. Moreover, dietary habits and insulin administration for glycemic \ncontrol did not alter pulmonary artery Doppler metrics. The findings suggest \nthat well-managed gestational diabetes mellitus, irrespective of the treatment \nmodality, do not substantially influence the fetal pulmonary artery dynamics.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).
