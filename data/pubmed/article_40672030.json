While psychosocial risk factors \nare well established, the potential mechanistic role of obstetric complications \nin precipitating these conditions remains less clearly delineated.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between specific \nobstetric complications and the risk of postpartum depression and psychosis \nwithin six months after delivery, using a biopsychosocial framework.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective, matched case-control study using medical \nrecords from Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar (Pakistan), covering deliveries \nfrom January 2018 to December 2023. Cases included women aged 18-45 years \ndiagnosed with PPD or PPP within six months postpartum based on DSM-5 criteria. \nControls were women who delivered during the same period without psychiatric \ndiagnoses, matched 2:1 by age, parity, and delivery mode. Obstetric \ncomplications assessed included preeclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes \nmellitus (GDM), postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, placental abruption, \nintrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), chorioamnionitis, and cesarean delivery. \nConditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) \nwith 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: A total of 220 cases and 440 matched controls were analyzed. \nPreeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.45-3.64; p<0.001), postpartum \nhemorrhage (aOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.30-3.38; p=0.002), preterm birth (aOR: 1.85; \n95% CI: 1.20-2.85; p=0.004), and GDM (aOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.00-2.40; p=0.049) \nwere significantly associated with increased risk of postpartum psychiatric \ndisorders. No significant associations were found for placental abruption, IUGR, \nchorioamnionitis, or cesarean delivery.\nCONCLUSION: Obstetric complications-particularly preeclampsia/eclampsia, \npostpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes-may act as \nphysiological stressors that interact with underlying vulnerabilities, \nconsistent with stress-diathesis and inflammatory models of psychopathology. \nThese findings support a multifactorial conceptualization of postpartum \npsychiatric illness and emphasize the importance of integrating obstetric risk \nprofiles into postpartum mental health screenings. In low-resource settings like \nPakistan, targeting women with complicated deliveries and known psychosocial \nrisk factors through collaborative, interdisciplinary care models can help \nprevent chronic maternal mental health conditions and improve developmental \noutcomes for children.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025, Kamal et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.86156\nPMCID: PMC12266803\nPMID: 40672030\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.
