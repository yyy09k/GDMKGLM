BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients typically undergo either 
an ovulation induction regimen or a programmed regimen for endometrial 
preparation before frozen embryo transfer (FET). However, the superiority of one 
approach over the other remains controversial. While previous studies suggest 
that the letrozole regimen may improve pregnancy outcomes, prospective studies 
are insufficient. Therefore, we designed a multi-center randomized controlled 
trial to compare the pregnancy outcomes between these two regimens in PCOS 
patients undergoing FET.
METHODS: This multicentre, randomised controlled, open-label trial included 155 
PCOS patients from six hospitals in China between September 2022 and February 
2024. Patients were randomised into either the letrozole ovulation regimen group 
(n = 81) or the programmed regimen group (n = 74) during FET cycles. Subgroup 
analysis was used among patients with single blastocyst transfer. The primary 
outcome was clinical pregnancy rate, with secondary outcomes including abortion 
rate, live birth rate, and other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.
RESULTS: Analysis of 155 FET women showed no significant difference in clinical 
pregnancy rates between the letrozole group (62.96%) and the programmed group 
(60.81%, P > 0.05). Similarly, no differences were observed in abortion rate, 
live birth rate, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes 
mellitus, preterm birth, or neonatal birth weight. However, more patients in the 
letrozole group received single-drug luteal support (53.16% vs. 16.67%, 
P < 0.05). A subgroup analysis of 108 women involving patients who underwent 
single blastocyst transfer revealed no significant differences in clinical 
pregnancy rates (66.67% vs. 73.33%, P > 0.05) or live birth rates (58.73% vs. 
55.56%, P > 0.05) between the two groups. A higher proportion of women in the 
letrozole ovulation regimen group received single-drug luteal support compared 
to those in the programmed regimen group (58.73% vs. 22.22%, P < 0.05). No 
statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in terms 
of fertilization method, abortion rate, or obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The letrozole ovulation regimen demonstrated comparable clinical 
pregnancy rates to the programmed regimen in PCOS patients undergoing FET, while 
requiring only simple luteal support. These findings suggest that the letrozole 
regimen may be a favourable alternative for endometrial preparation in this 
population.
