BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses health risks to mothers 
and infants. This study investigates the link between husband-reported snoring 
in early pregnancy and GDM risk.
METHODS: From July 2021 to June 2023, 1200 pregnant women were recruited at 
Babol University of Medical Sciences. Data collection included the Snoring 
Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at the first antenatal visit. 
GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks using an oral glucose tolerance test based on 
ADA criteria.
RESULTS: Persistent snorers had significantly higher fasting blood sugar levels, 
elevated 1-3-hour glucose levels, and a higher GDM prevalence (19.1% vs. 9.3%; 
p < 0.001) compared to soft snorers. After adjusting for confounding variables, 
occasional snoring (AOR: 3.93; 95% CI: 1.73-8.95; p = 0.001), frequent snoring 
(AOR: 4.02; 95% CI: 1.56-10.36; p = 0.004), and persistent snoring (AOR: 3.24; 
95% CI: 2.04-5.13; p < 0.001) were associated with significantly increased GDM 
risk. A forest plot showed a significant trend of increased GDM risk with higher 
husband-reported snoring frequency (P < 0.001). No significant association was 
observed between daytime sleepiness and GDM.
CONCLUSIONS: Husband-reported snoring in early pregnancy, especially frequent 
snoring, is significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. These 
findings highlight the potential role of sleep assessments in prenatal care for 
early identification and management of GDM risk.
