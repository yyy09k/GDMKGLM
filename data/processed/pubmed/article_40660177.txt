AIMS: Given the limited data on the effects of metformin exposure in pregnancy, 
this study aims to investigate the association between metformin use in 
Gestational Diabetes (GDM) and the risk of short-term maternal and neonatal 
outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included women with GDM who sought 
prenatal care at Sidra Medicine, Qatar, between January 2019 and December 2020 
and compared maternal and neonatal outcomes in patients treated with metformin 
to those treated with diet control alone.
RESULTS: Six hundred forty nine GDM patients were included, of which 438 were 
treated with diet only, and 211 were treated with metformin. At baseline, the 
metformin-treated group was older (33.3 ± 4.8 vs. 31.2 ± 5.0 years), had higher 
pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI) (27.9 ± 4.6 vs. 26.0 ± 4.7 kg/m2), but had 
lower gestational weight gain (0.28 ± 0.20 vs. 0.34 ± 0.17 kg/week) than the 
diet group (p <.001). When adjusted for age, fasting glucose at diagnosis, 
pre-pregnancy weight, and gestational weight gain, metformin treatment was not 
associated with an increased risk of any adverse pregnancy outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with metformin was not associated with an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes, including small for gestational age and preterm labor in 
women with GDM.
