BACKGROUND: Maternal prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) have been linked to adverse birth outcomes. However, few investigations 
have considered paternal PFAS exposure. We estimated the parent-specific 
associations of prenatal PFAS exposures with adverse birth outcomes.
METHODS: This study included 498 couples from the INUENDO cohort recruited at 
antenatal care visits in Greenland, Poland, and Ukraine during 2002-2004. We 
measured five major types of PFAS in parental serum during pregnancy. We 
analyzed three birth outcomes ascertained from medical records, including 
gestational age, birth weight, and birth length. We used weighted least squares 
linear regression to evaluate parent-specific associations of serum PFAS with 
the birth outcomes, adjusting for parental co-exposures and covariates. We also 
used quantile g-computation for mixture modeling of the birth outcomes of 
paternal and/or maternal exposures to multiple PFAS.
RESULTS: No associations were found between maternal and paternal PFAS exposures 
and gestational age. However, after adjusting for paternal PFOA, a higher level 
of maternal serum perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was linked to a tendency towards 
lower birth weight and shorter birth length. Paternal exposure to several PFAS 
was also associated with a tendency for shorter birth length, but the estimated 
effect sizes were small. We found no joint exposure effects in the mixture 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: While the evidence was inconclusive, maternal PFOA and paternal 
PFAS exposures seemed to be associated with lower offspring birth weight and 
shorter birth length, respectively. Parent-specific effects of PFAS exposures on 
offspring growth and development warrant further research.
