AIMS: To evaluate GDM screening compliance and prevalence, and the association 
between gestational glucose intolerance and 5-year postpartum diabetes mellitus 
(DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used population-based data from three Israeli health 
maintenance organisations (HMOs), covering 75% of all births in 2016. GDM 
screening followed a two-step approach: a 50-g 1-h oral glucose challenge test 
(OGCT), followed by a 100-g 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using 
Carpenter-Coustan criteria. Data included age, socioeconomic status (SES), 
results of OGCT and OGTT tests, child birth weight, and gestational age. The 
dataset was linked to the Israeli National Diabetes Registry to identify 
postpartum DM. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) for GDM 
and postpartum DM, adjusting for maternal age, SES, ethnicity, and glucose 
tolerance status.
RESULTS: Among 128,454 women, 10% were unscreened. Of those screened, 23,451 
underwent the full OGTT. GDM prevalence was 4.3%. Postpartum DM incidence was 
8.6% in women with GDM, 3.1% with unknown GDM status, and 2.1% with impaired 
glucose tolerance (IGT) (defined as one abnormal value on the OGTT). Compared 
with normoglycemia, adjusted ORs for the 5-year postpartum DM were 25.48 (95% 
CI: 21.80-29.79) for GDM, 10.04 (95% CI: 8.59-11.74) for unknown GDM status, 
6.48 (95% CI: 5.07-8.28) for IGT, and 2.17 (95% CI: 1.63-2.88) for abnormal OGCT 
with normal OGTT. Older age, lower SES, and Arab or Bedouin ethnicity were 
linked to higher GDM and postpartum DM.
CONCLUSIONS: Gestational glucose intolerance and screening gaps were strong 
predictors of postpartum DM. Age, SES, and ethnicity highlight the need for 
targeted efforts to reduce health disparities.
