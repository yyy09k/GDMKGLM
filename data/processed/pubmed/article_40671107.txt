BACKGROUND: Women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at a 
significantly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes after childbirth. 
However, studies on the impact of dietary factors on the postpartum endocrine 
metabolism of women with prior GDM, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain 
relatively limited. This study aims to investigate the association and 
underlying pathways between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and the subsequent 
development of type 2 diabetes in women with prior GDM, and to help identify 
high-risk populations.
METHODS: The sample included 788 participants from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2018. Multivariate logistic 
regression was utilized to examine the correlation of DII with diabetes and 
adiposity indices, such as body mass index (BMI) and relative fat mass (RFM) in 
participants with prior GDM. Mediation analysis was conducted to examine the 
effects of adiposity indices as potential mediators between DII and diabetes. 
Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between 
the 26 dietary components of the DII on adiposity indices and the occurrence of 
diabetes in participants with prior GDM.
RESULTS: Among participants with prior GDM, higher DII scores were associated 
with the occurrence of diabetes after variable adjustment. Mediation analysis 
disclosed that adiposity indices mediated a substantial portion of the 
relationship between DII and diabetes, with BMI (12.19%) and RFM (11.84%) 
showing significant mediating effects. Spearman correlation analysis indicated 
that different dietary components exhibited varying degrees of correlation with 
adiposity indices and diabetes among participants with prior GDM.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher DII scores were associated with the occurrence of diabetes 
in women with prior GDM, partly mediated by adiposity indices, emphasizing the 
role of diet in diabetes risk. Additionally, the findings suggested that these 
adiposity indices should be more broadly utilized to improve early diabetes 
prevention and treatment strategies among women with prior GDM.
