BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing public health 
concern globally, particularly in the context of rising maternal obesity and 
glucose intolerance. GDM poses significant risks to both neonatal and maternal 
health, including fetal overgrowth, birth complications, and long-term metabolic 
disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GDM on neonatal birth 
weight and maternal postpartum metabolic changes. The primary objective was to 
assess the incidence of macrosomia and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births in 
pregnancies complicated by GDM. Secondary objectives included evaluating 
postpartum glycemic and lipid profiles, comparing metabolic parameters at six 
weeks and six months between GDM and non-GDM groups, and identifying predictive 
and moderating variables such as glycemic control, pre-pregnancy BMI, and 
gestational weight gain.
METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort study was conducted over an 18-month period 
(October 2023 to April 2025) at Health Net Hospital, a tertiary care and 
referral center located in Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 219 pregnant women 
were initially screened for eligibility. Following the application of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, 189 women were enrolled, 94 diagnosed with GDM and 95 
without GDM, serving as matched controls. Data were collected at three time 
points: during the second trimester (baseline), at delivery, and during 
postpartum follow-up at six weeks and six months. Maternal metabolic markers, 
including glycemic and lipid profiles, were assessed longitudinally, while 
neonatal outcomes such as birth weight, NICU admission, and hypoglycemia were 
documented at birth. Follow-up adherence was ensured through scheduled reminders 
and flexible appointment rescheduling. Clinical and laboratory data were 
collected using standardized protocols by trained staff. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to identify independent predictors of adverse maternal and 
neonatal outcomes, with adjustments for potential confounders. Data analysis was 
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0.2.0 (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, New York, United States).
RESULTS: Neonates of GDM mothers had significantly higher birth weights (mean 
3689 g vs. 3143 g; p<0.0001), with increased incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia 
in 16 (17%) GDM cases compared to four (4.2%) non-GDM cases and NICU admissions 
in 19 (20.2%) GDM neonates versus five (5.3%) non-GDM neonates. GDM mothers 
exhibited elevated fasting glucose at six weeks (mean 98.5 mg/dL) and six months 
(94.1 mg/dL) postpartum, compared to non-GDM mothers (85.3 mg/dL and 83.2 mg/dL, 
respectively; p<0.0001). Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance 
(HOMA-IR) and triglyceride levels were also significantly higher in the GDM 
group. GDM (OR=2.8), higher pre-pregnancy BMI, and poor glycemic control (HbA1c 
>5.9%) were independent predictors of neonatal macrosomia and maternal insulin 
resistance.
CONCLUSION: GDM significantly increases the risk of macrosomia, neonatal 
complications, and sustained maternal metabolic dysfunction postpartum. These 
findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis, effective glycemic 
control, and structured postpartum follow-up to mitigate long-term risks.
