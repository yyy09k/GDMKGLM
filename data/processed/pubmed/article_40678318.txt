OBJECTIVE: To explore early management strategies for full-term neonates with 
TSH 5-10 mU/L and normal FT4.
METHODS: In this single-center longitudinal prospective study, 88 neonates 
diagnosed at 7-14 days were followed to age three.
RESULTS: 94.3% (83/88) had transient TSH elevation; 77 normalized within two 
months without treatment, while six received levothyroxine (3-5µg/kg/day). Five 
neonates (5.7%) exhibited persistent hyperthyrotropinemia and had significantly 
higher initial TSH. No hyperthyroidism was observed. Following up to 3 years 
old, only one child (1/81, 1.2%) exhibited development delay in personal-social 
development. Neonates with transient hyperthyrotropinaemia scored higher in 
problem-solving and personal-social domains than those with persistent 
hyperthyrotropinaemia. Neonatal FT4 at 7-14 days, timing of TSH normalization, 
and maternal early-pregnancy FT4 influenced the neurodevelopment of neonates. 
Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes scored lower in the personal-social 
domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent hyperthyrotropinemia occurs in 5.7% of mild cases and is 
associated with higher initial TSH. Levothyroxine at 3-5 µg/kg/day is both 
adequate and safe. The majority of neonates got a normal neurodevelopment by age 
3, and the subtle difference between transient and persistent 
hyperthyrotropinemia was impacted by both maternal and neonatal factors.
