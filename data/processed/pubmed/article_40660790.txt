BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent metabolic 
disorder that disrupts fetal central nervous system (CNS) development. This 
study investigates the effects of maternal diabetes on hippocampal structure and 
autophagy-related mechanisms in neonatal rats, focusing on the PI3K/mTOR 
signaling pathway.
METHODS: Forty female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CON), 
diabetic (STZ-D), and insulin-treated diabetic (STZ-INS). Hyperglycemia was 
induced using streptozotocin, and offspring were analyzed at postnatal day 14 
(P14). Histological evaluations of hippocampal structure were conducted using 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and neuronal damage was assessed with 
toluidine blue staining. Autophagy-related gene expression (Beclin-1, LC-3, 
ATG-7) and the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway were examined using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Offspring from the STZ-D group exhibited significant reductions in 
hippocampal volume and increased dark neurons in the CA1 and CA2 regions 
compared to the CON and STZ-INS groups. Gene expression analysis revealed a 
marked downregulation of ATG-7 and significant upregulation of PI3K and mTOR in 
the STZ-D group, while Beclin-1 and LC-3 showed no significant changes. Insulin 
treatment mitigated these adverse effects, preserving hippocampal structure and 
reducing neuronal damage. In addition, the results of the Voronoi tessellation 
method showed that hippocampal neural cells depict a regular pattern in 
different subfields in all experimental groups.
CONCLUSION: Maternal hyperglycemia disrupts hippocampal development by altering 
autophagy and activating the PI3K/mTOR pathway, contributing to neuronal damage. 
Insulin treatment during pregnancy can counteract these effects, emphasizing the 
importance of glycemic control. These findings highlight potential therapeutic 
targets for mitigating CNS impairments in the offspring of diabetic mothers.
