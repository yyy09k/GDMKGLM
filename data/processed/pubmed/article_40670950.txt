OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the relationship between periodontitis 
and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to ascertain the role of systemic 
inflammation in mediating this association.
METHODS: Data from 5,283 women of reproductive age ranging from 20 to 44 years 
were retrieved from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) III (1988-1994) and NHANES 2009-2014 cycles. The female participants 
were categorized into three groups: non-diabetes, DM, and GDM. Multivariate 
logistic and linear regression models were employed to assess the correlations 
between periodontal variables and diabetes status. Additionally, a mediation 
analysis was performed to explore the role of systemic inflammatory biomarkers.
RESULTS: Compared to non-periodontitis, women with periodontitis have a 1.68 
times higher risk of having GDM (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.14-2.50). Clinical 
attachment level (CAL), the continuous periodontal parameter, also presented a 
significant association with GDM risk (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25-1.81 per 1-mm 
increase). Linear regression analyses further revealed that hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) levels were positively associated with periodontitis (Beta = 0.19, 
SE = 0.06, p < 0.01) and CAL (Beta = 0.06, SE = 0.03, p < 0.001), respectively. 
The association between periodontitis and GDM risk was found to be mediated by 
white blood cell count (WBC), monocyte count, and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio 
(MLR), with mediation proportions of 5.02%, 5.88%, and 5.20%, respectively. 
Similar mediation effects were observed for the CAL-GDM association.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that periodontitis was associated with 
GDM among women of childbearing age, with systemic inflammation potentially 
serving as a partial mediator of this association.
