BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) significantly impacts long-term 
child health outcomes. This study assessed neonatologists' knowledge, attitudes, 
and practices (KAP) regarding GDM-related complications in offspring.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,614 neonatologists in Hubei Province, 
China, utilized a validated 28-item questionnaire examining knowledge (12 
items), attitudes (8 items), and practices (8 items). Responses were scored on a 
trichotomous scale. Binary logistic regression analyzed predictors of 
satisfactory performance across domains.
RESULTS: Among 1,614 neonatologists, 1,437 (89%) demonstrated satisfactory 
knowledge, 1,513 (94%) positive attitudes, and 1,165 (72%) good practices. 
Knowledgeable practitioners were significantly older (45.4 vs 36.2 years; OR 
1.42 [95% CI 1.40-1.44]; p<.001) with greater experience (13.8 vs 10.5 years; 
1.41 [1.35-1.46]; p<.001). Academic hospital affiliation showed higher 
competency versus community settings (0.12 [0.08-0.20]; p<.001). Practice 
patterns varied by education, with MD-PhD holders demonstrating higher odds of 
good practice (1.32 [1.03-1.71]; P=.032) compared with fellowship training (0.69 
[0.51-0.92]; p=.009). Universal documentation of maternal GDM coexisted with 
suboptimal rates of periodic evaluations (81%) and specialist referrals (84%). 
Knowledge competency (7.52 [5.90-9.60]; p<.001) and positive attitudes (15.81 
[9.90-25.26]; p<.001) strongly predicted practice patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high knowledge levels and positive attitudes, particularly 
among experienced practitioners in academic settings, implementation gaps exist 
in follow-up protocols and specialist referrals. Practice setting significantly 
influences care delivery, suggesting the need for standardized protocols across 
healthcare tiers.
