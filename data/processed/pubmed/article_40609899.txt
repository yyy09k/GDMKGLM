OBJECTIVE: Gestational diabetes is associated with an increased risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Self-care interventions are known to 
prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations. This systematic review aimed 
to investigate whether self-care interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes among 
women with previous gestational diabetes.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, 
and PsycINFO was conducted on December 2nd, 2024.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised, cluster-randomised, and non-randomised 
controlled trials that compared the effects of self-care interventions with 
standard/usual care or no intervention for preventing type 2 diabetes among 
women with previous gestational diabetes were included. The primary outcomes 
were the incidence of type 2 diabetes, the composite incidence of any type of 
diabetes, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose level two 
hours after the oral glucose tolerance test, and body weight.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Risk of bias for included studies was 
assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB2), or the Risk of Bias In 
Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I). Random effects models 
were employed for meta-analyses. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using 
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
approach.
RESULTS: The search identified 35 trials including 6624 women. Only one 
randomised trial (n=1601) reported the incidence of type 2 diabetes, indicating 
that the lifestyle intervention focusing on diet and physical activity may have 
little to no effect (hazard ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.22], 
low certainty of evidence). The effects of self-care interventions on the other 
primary outcomes - composite incidence of any type of diabetes (three trials), 
glycated haemoglobin (three trials), fasting blood glucose (11 trials), blood 
glucose level two hours after the oral glucose tolerance test (six trials), and 
body weight (18 trials) were uncertain (very low certainty of evidence). 
Downgrading of the certainty of evidence was predominantly due to high risk of 
bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.
CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence on the effect of self-care interventions for the 
prevention of type 2 diabetes among women with previous gestational diabetes is 
insufficient to draw strong conclusions, necessitating further research.
