BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy involving 
multiple organ systems, primarily due to impaired placental development during 
the first trimester. Reduced Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF) and elevated 
Glycosylated Fibronectin (GlyFn) levels reflect these pathological changes. 
Combining these biomarkers into a ratio may enhance PE prediction in high-risk 
pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the GlyFn/PlGF ratio measured at 20-28 weeks of gestation 
as a predictor of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies across four hospitals in 
West Java, Indonesia, from April-October 2024.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study involved 54 high-risk pregnant women. The 
GlyFn/PlGF ratio was analyzed at 20-28 weeks to assess predictive accuracy for 
PE.
RESULTS: Significant differences were noted between PE and non-PE groups in 
pre-pregnancy weight (65.54 ± 12.69 vs. 58.53 ± 7.85 kg), BMI (45.52 ± 53.73 vs. 
19.84 ± 2.97), and systolic blood pressure (153.50 ± 19.42 vs. 100.80 ± 15.38 
mmHg) (P > 0.05). Risk factors such as prior PE (P = 0.01), diabetes mellitus 
(P = 0.03), and gestational hypertension (P = 0.02) were more frequent in the PE 
group. A GlyFn cutoff of 34.31 ng/mL showed a 2.5-fold increased PE risk 
(sensitivity: 83.33%, specificity: 66.67%, AUC: 0.8071). A PlGF cutoff of 26.72 
pg/mL was associated with a 6.8-fold increased risk (sensitivity: 72.22%, 
specificity: 97.22%, AUC: 0.9147). The GlyFn/PlGF ratio cutoff of 1.288 
indicated a 28-fold higher PE risk (sensitivity: 77.78%, specificity: 97.37%, 
AUC: 0.9244).
CONCLUSION: The GlyFn/PlGF ratio outperforms individual biomarkers in predicting 
preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies, offering a valuable tool for early risk 
identification and timely intervention.
