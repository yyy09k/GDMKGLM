OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of patient education interventions on fasting 
blood glucose (FBG) in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
METHODS: Electronic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier), 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Clinicaltrials.gov 
was conducted from inception to September 16, 2022. Randomized controlled trials 
which evaluated the effect of GDM-specific education on biochemical assessment 
of FBG during pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum in patients with GDM were 
included. Meta-analysis was performed of studies reporting FBG using a fixed 
effects model to determine mean blood glucose difference and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess study 
quality.
RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials enrolling 1885 patients were 
included. A total of 8 studies with 893 participants were eligible for inclusion 
in the meta-analysis. The mean effect size was significant: Cohen's d = -0.53 
(95% CI [-0.67, -0.34], z = -7.36; p < 0.001). The overall risk of bias for 
included studies was low.
CONCLUSION: A GDM-specific education intervention resulted in improved glucose 
control during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks postpartum. Due to the number of 
studies a moderator analysis could not be conducted to determine the most 
effective educational intervention strategies. More studies are needed to 
determine efficacious interventions that are cost-effective and can be broadly 
implemented throughout health systems.
