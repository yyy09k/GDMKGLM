AIM: Gestational diabetes mellitus is defined as any glucose intolerance that 
begins during pregnancy, and it is one of the most common metabolic disorders 
complicating pregnancies, affecting approximately 10-14% of all pregnancies. 
Maternal carbohydrate metabolism changes during pregnancy to ensure adequate 
nutrition for the fetus, with the human umbilical vein and the placenta being 
important regulators of this physiological state. This study aimed to evaluate 
fractalkine (FKN) immunoreactivity in GDM pregnancies and its association with 
maternal/fetal health outcomes.
METHODS: In this case-control study, a total of 89 pregnant women (44 GDM and 45 
non-GDM) underwent a 50 g glucose loading test (GCT) between 24 and 28 weeks of 
gestation. GCT cutoff value was chosen as <140 mg/dl. Women with high GCT values 
underwent rapid diagnostic testing with a 3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT). 
Placenta samples were obtained after cesarean section. Immunohistochemistry for 
FKN was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections. Finally, the 
relationship between FKN expression and clinical manifestations of GDM was 
evaluated.
RESULTS: FKN expression was significantly different between pregnant women with 
and without GDM. Specifically, FKN expression was increased in the capillary 
endothelium (p < 0.0001) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
(p = 0.0011) in pregnant women with GDM compared to those without GDM. 
Furthermore, FKN expression in HUVECs was found to be associated with fetal 
macrosomia (p = 0.0099) and neonatal hypoglycemia (p = 0.0291). Additionally, 
FKN expression in the capillary endothelium was found to be associated with 
preeclampsia (p = 0.0250). Regarding the pathological changes of the placenta 
with FKN expression, significant correlations were identified with both 
capillary endothelial FKN expression and HUVEC FKN expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences suggest a potential association between 
the immunohistochemical expression of FKN and the presence of GDM, placental 
changes, and adverse outcomes of pregnancy.
