BACKGROUND: Unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (uRPL), defined as the loss of 
two or more pregnancies without an identified cause, affects approximately 1-2% 
of women trying to conceive. Emerging evidence suggests that an imbalance in 
maternal-fetal immunological tolerance may play a key role in its pathogenesis. 
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a glycosylated polypeptide chain 
cell growth factor, has shown promise in improving pregnancy outcomes in uRPL, 
although findings from previous clinical trials are inconsistent. High-quality, 
adequately powered studies are urgently needed to determine its clinical 
utility. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G-CSF in Chinese 
women with uRPL, providing a more theoretical basis for clinical practice.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical 
trial will enroll 528 eligible participants, assigned to test group (n = 264, 
G-CSF 150 μg, subcutaneously every other day) and control group (n = 264, 
placebo), starting after confirmation of early pregnancy and ending at 
10 weeks + 0 days of gestation. All participants will also receive 
dydrogesterone and aspirin as supportive care. The primary endpoint is fetal 
survival to 24 weeks, and secondary endpoints are early pregnancy loss, 
clinically confirmed pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, fetal survival to 28 weeks, 
ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth, stillbirth, and pregnancy complications 
(preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, HELLP syndrome, placental 
abruption). The trial will also explore subgroup effects based on research 
centers (4 centers), age, number of pregnancy losses, and body mass index.
DISCUSSION: This trial aims to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy and 
safety of G-CSF in the treatment of uRPL, particularly in the Chinese population 
where existing data are limited. The findings may support evidence-based 
recommendations and inform treatment decisions in a population where therapeutic 
options remain limited and controversial.

Conflict of interest statement: Declarations. Ethics approval and consent to 
participate {24}.: According to the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol 
obtained approval from the Lanzhou University Second Hospital (2023A-530) and 
was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300077436) prior 
to the study’s initiation. The principal investigator will strive to draft the 
informed consent form and supporting documents in simple language to obtain 
informed consent from patients and their legally authorized representatives. No 
study procedures will be performed until written informed consent is provided. 
The clinical findings of this trial will be compiled into a manuscript for 
presentation at scientific conferences or publication in scientific journals 
following the completion of the trial. The manuscript will be discussed and 
approved by all principal investigators of the centers involved in the study.
