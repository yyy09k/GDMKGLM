The aim of this study was to compare pregnancy, obstetrical outcomes and number 
of visits between patients undergoing frozen embryo transfer in artificial vs 
modified natural cycle. A total of 1207 frozen single embryo transfer cycles 
performed in 2022 were retrospectively studied. Patients older than 40, with 
recurrent implantation failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss were excluded. 
Patients were divided according to their age, BMI, AMH, and type of embryo 
transfer protocol. Patients in the modified natural cycle group were followed by 
ultrasound until triggering criteria met, then HCG trigger was scheduled, and 
the embryo transferred 7 days later. In the artificial cycle group, patients 
received estrogen supplementation after downregulation, and when the endometrium 
reached a thickness ≥ 7 mm an embryo transfer was scheduled following 
intramuscular progesterone administration for 5 days. A total of 649 patients 
were included in the study. A higher percentage of patients in the artificial 
cycle group had an initial positive B-hCG test result. The modified natural 
group had significantly better clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, mainly 
due to the significantly higher miscarriage rate observed in the artificial 
cycle group. There was no difference in the mean endometrial thickness between 
both groups. The number of visits was higher in the m-NC group. Patients with a 
m-NC protocol had a lower risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), but 
a higher risk of gestational diabetes, though the results were non-significant. 
In conclusion embryo transfer in m-NC yielded a higher live birth rate, more 
frequent clinic visits, and lower chances of miscarriage.
