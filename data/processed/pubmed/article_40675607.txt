INTRODUCTION: SMFM and ACOG recommend delivery of gravidae with pregestational 
diabetes at 36-39 6/7 weeks based on glycemic control and vascular 
complications. The optimal gestational age within this wide range is unknown. 
Our objective was to evaluate the risk of adverse outcomes with delivery versus 
expectant management at increasing gestational ages.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of gravidae with pregestational diabetes who 
delivered a non-anomalous singleton at 36 weeks (2012-2022). The primary 
outcome was composite neonatal morbidity: hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, 
shoulder dystocia, and perinatal death. Secondary outcomes included composite 
components, composite severe neonatal morbidity, LGA, SGA, NICU admission and 
cesarean. Poisson regression with robust error variance estimated the 
association between delivery at 36, 37, and 38 weeks and outcomes, compared with 
expectant management.
RESULTS: 843 gravidae met inclusion criteria: 235 (28%) type 1 diabetes and 602 
(71%) type 2 diabetes. Overall, 146 (17%) delivered at 36 weeks, 283 (34%) at 37 
weeks, 217 (26%) at 38 weeks, and 197 (23%) at 39 weeks. Compared with 
expectant management, delivery at 36 weeks was associated with higher odds of 
composite morbidity (aRR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55) as well as hypoglycemia, 
hyperbilirubinemia, SGA and NICU admission. At 37 and 38 weeks, there was no 
significant difference in composite morbidity among those delivered versus 
expectantly managed. However, delivery at 37 weeks was associated with higher 
odds of hyperbilirubinemia, compared with expectant management. No other 
outcomes differed between with delivery versus expectant management at 37 or 38 
weeks. Few associations differed by diabetes type.
CONCLUSION: Based on these results and supporting literature, elective delivery 
at 36 weeks should be avoided unless necessary. Although the data are 
inconclusive regarding delivery at 37 weeks, delivery at 38 weeks should be 
evaluated further for gravidae with pregestational diabetes. Confirmation in a 
large, contemporary cohort or a randomized trial are needed.
