INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia are prevalent 
pregnancy complications that threaten maternal and infant health while imposing 
substantial socioeconomic burdens. Although several interventions exist, 
shortcomings in individualized treatment and other limitations necessitate 
urgent in-depth research. This study aimed to examine alterations in 
autophagy-related gene expression in preeclampsia combined with GDM.
METHODS: We conducted bioinformatics analyses including gene expression 
profiling, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), gene ontology 
(GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses, machine learning modeling, immune 
infiltration analyses, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed 
autophagy-related genes linked to preeclampsia with GDM were identified. 
Expression levels of four key genes were validated in placental samples using 
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: Our findings identified potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms 
underlying preeclampsia with GDM. Single-cell analysis corroborated these 
results, revealing distinct autophagy-related gene signatures and enhancing 
understanding of the pathophysiology.
DISCUSSION: This study elucidates molecular mechanisms connecting GDM and 
preeclampsia, identifies novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and provides 
a valuable reference for future research and clinical applications. The 
integration of multi-omics approaches advances precision medicine strategies for 
these comorbid conditions.
