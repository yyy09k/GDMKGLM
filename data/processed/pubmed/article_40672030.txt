BACKGROUND: Postpartum psychiatric disorders, including postpartum depression 
(PPD) and postpartum psychosis (PPP), are major contributors to maternal 
morbidity and adverse child outcomes globally. While psychosocial risk factors 
are well established, the potential mechanistic role of obstetric complications 
in precipitating these conditions remains less clearly delineated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between specific 
obstetric complications and the risk of postpartum depression and psychosis 
within six months after delivery, using a biopsychosocial framework.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, matched case-control study using medical 
records from Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar (Pakistan), covering deliveries 
from January 2018 to December 2023. Cases included women aged 18-45 years 
diagnosed with PPD or PPP within six months postpartum based on DSM-5 criteria. 
Controls were women who delivered during the same period without psychiatric 
diagnoses, matched 2:1 by age, parity, and delivery mode. Obstetric 
complications assessed included preeclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM), postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, placental abruption, 
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), chorioamnionitis, and cesarean delivery. 
Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 220 cases and 440 matched controls were analyzed. 
Preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.45-3.64; p<0.001), postpartum 
hemorrhage (aOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.30-3.38; p=0.002), preterm birth (aOR: 1.85; 
95% CI: 1.20-2.85; p=0.004), and GDM (aOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.00-2.40; p=0.049) 
were significantly associated with increased risk of postpartum psychiatric 
disorders. No significant associations were found for placental abruption, IUGR, 
chorioamnionitis, or cesarean delivery.
CONCLUSION: Obstetric complications-particularly preeclampsia/eclampsia, 
postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes-may act as 
physiological stressors that interact with underlying vulnerabilities, 
consistent with stress-diathesis and inflammatory models of psychopathology. 
These findings support a multifactorial conceptualization of postpartum 
psychiatric illness and emphasize the importance of integrating obstetric risk 
profiles into postpartum mental health screenings. In low-resource settings like 
Pakistan, targeting women with complicated deliveries and known psychosocial 
risk factors through collaborative, interdisciplinary care models can help 
prevent chronic maternal mental health conditions and improve developmental 
outcomes for children.
