MRS PARIMALA, DIAGNOSED WITH GDM DURING THE THIRD MONTH 
OF HER SECOND PREGNANCY:
 I have a three-year-old child and I am currently seven 
months pregnant. I did not have high blood glucose 
levels during my first pregnancy, and back then I was 
not aware about GDM. Now I am aware about this 
condition and related complications… I was advised 
to follow a diet – restrict sugar and carbohydrates, 
eat more wheat products; and to exercise. Besides, 
my mother-in-law has diabetes so it is easy for me to 
follow the diet for GDM.
 
 I feel relaxed to tell others that I have GDM. Many people 
in my area have similar problems. I sometimes get advice 
from other people with diabetes about diet and I am 
receiving support from everyone I know. Also, I am willing 
to support with all information I can should someone 
come to me for an advice.

SUMMARY REPORT 
05
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a serious reproductive, maternal and child 
health issue, with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 
contributing to maternal morbidity and mortality. 
GDM is a temporary disease that occurs during 
pregnancy and can lead to an increased risk of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes (T2D) later in life. Additionally, 
the disease poses great risk to pregnant women and 
their children. Despite the increase in the prevalence 
of GDM it yet remains a neglected issue, particularly 
in low- and middle- income countries.
Currently at 66 million, India is the second most 
prevalent country in the world with people living with 
T2D. Global estimates of pregnancies associated 
with hyperglycaemia were at 20.9 million, of which 
approximately 17.8 million being associated with 
GDM1. Over 5 million of these GDM cases were in 
India alone. Moreover, many of these women expe-
rience pregnancy related complications including 
high blood pressure, large birth weight babies and 
obstructed labour.

The IDF and the Abbott fund from the global health-
care company Abbott, together committed to raising 
this important health issue onto the global develop-
ment agenda and improving pregnancy outcomes 
in women with GDM. This project had support from 
the local partners the Madras Diabetes Research 
Foundation (MRDF Chennai, India) who played an 
important role in implementation in surrounding 
semi-urban and rural areas of the city.
The Women in India with GDM Strategy (WINGS 
project) is one of IDF’s flagship projects which aimed 
to tackle the growing problem of GDM in low-re-
source settings.
This project aimed to provide a situational exam-
ination of the burden of GDM in India. It looked to 
establish a model of care using evidence-based 
guidelines for GDM treatment that could be applied 
in low-resource settings globally.
AIM OF THE WINGS PROJECT

The IDF approach for care and management of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
* This presents a good opportunity for a T2D prevention project in women who experienced GDM as follow up 
rates in India after delivery are generally much lower (10-20% general follow up rate in post-partum women)
This is a succinct report of the WINGS project on GDM after four successful years in Chennai (2012-2016).
1,126 
women 
screened
247 
cases of GDM 
identified
212 
(95.8%) pregnant women followed 
throughout their pregnancy 
under the IDF GDM MOC*
203 
(95.8%) successfully 
completed the follow 
up postpartum

This programme provided community-based 
interventions for women with GDM and educa-
tional material for health outreach workers. Over 
2,100 pregnant women were involved in this project.
An emphasis was placed on close patient-healthcare 
worker interaction.
METHODS AND TIMELINE
>2,100 
women 
involved 
in this project
>60 
physicians 
trained on 
implementation
Key findings suggested that adverse maternal and 
neonatal outcomes, for example the numbers of 
obstructed labour and caesarean sections, were signif-
icantly reduced. As a result of this project dozens of 
healthcare professionals are now able to manage GDM 
in their clinics. Educational resources and protocols, 
such as the Wings Toolkit, are now available in the local 
languages; English; French and Spanish.

MRS RAZIYA, DIAGNOSED WITH GDM AT NINETEEN WEEKS OF GESTATION:
 When I was diagnosed with GDM, I was very worried about my child developing diabetes. 
I am now following a meal plan prescribed by the Doctor and my sugar levels are 
well under control. It is sometimes very difficult to follow the advice as most of the 
times I feel hungry soon after having the meal. Luckily, my husband is very strict 
about me following the diet plan. He is the only person who really supports me.

SUMMARY REPORT 
MRS DHANYAPRIYA, DIAGNOSED WITH GDM AT EIGHT WEEKS 
OF PREGNANCY:
 When I was eight weeks pregnant, the Doctor told 
me that my blood sugar levels are too high. First 
I felt fear. But after consulting my new Dietician 
and Diabetologist I gained confidence.
 
 I am now following a meal plan and engaging in 
physical activity. Both my husband and mother-
in-law support me in following my diet plan. 
My Doctor advised me to walk 30 minutes every day. 
I felt so good afterwards that now I walk more than 
40 minutes a day. I am managing to keep my blood 
sugar levels well under control.

EVALUATION OF THE MODEL OF CARE
KEY FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES OF THE WINGS PROJECT
After implementation of the IDF WINGS MOC, there were a total of 11 scientific 
articles published based on findings from the project. Additionally there were over 
14 oral and poster presentations communicated at national and international event.
Comparison of 
maternal and 
fetal outcomes 
among Asian Indian 
women with and 
without gestational 
diabetes mellitus
AIMS — Comparing different maternal and foetal outcomes 
among pregnant women with and without GDM.
CONCLUSIONS — Women with GDM had significantly higher 
caesarean sections, pre-eclampsia and macrosomia 
than women without GDM. However this was significantly 
reduced when women with GDM used insulin therapy.
DOI:10.4103/2230-8210.183469
Glucose tolerance 
status of women 
with gestational 
diabetes at 6 
to 12 weeks 
postpartum
AIMS — To determine postpartum glucose tolerance in 
pregnant women with GDM.
CONCLUSIONS — Among Asian Indians rapid conversion to 
dysglycaemia occurs (even by 6-12 weeks postpartum). 
Therefore there is a need for a strategy to increase 
postpartum follow-up rates among women with GDM.
DOI:10.1016/J.DIABRES.2016.04.050
Prevalence of 
gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM) in 
Asian Indians using 
the world health 
organization criteria 
and the international 
association of diabetes 
and pregnancy study 
groups criteria
AIMS — To compare the prevalence rates of gestational 
diabetes mellitus using the World Health Organization 
and the International Association of Diabetes and 
Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria in Asian Indian women.
CONCLUSIONS — Use of the IADPSG criteria results in almost 
50% higher prevalence rates of GDM in Asian Indians. 
Moreover, the IADPSG and WHO 1999 criteria identify 
different individuals as having GDM.

the American Diabetes Association (ADA 
Congress 2014, San Francisco , USA)
Gestational weight 
gain and preg-
nancy outcomes 
in relation to body 
mass index in Asian 
Indian women
AIMS — To compare weight gain and outcomes in relation 
to obesity among pregnant women.
CONCLUSIONS — Normal and underweight women did not 
gain enough weight during pregnancy. Frequency of low 
birth weight babies is independent of maternal obesity. 
Generally, worse pregnancy outcomes are associated 
with maternal obesity.

SUMMARY REPORT 
AIMS — To develop a context adapted Model of Care to 
improve health outcomes in women with GDM and their 
babies in low and middle income countries.
CONCLUSIONS — The IDF WINGS Model of Care for GDM is a 
community- and facility-based intervention to address 
the need for better care for women with GDM. The project 
underscores the need for educating HCPs and the public 
regarding GDM and particularly about the improvement 
of postpartum follow up.

CONCLUSIONS — Proper GDM management through the WINGS 
model of care showed that women with GDM had similar 
maternal and foetal outcomes to women without GDM.
DOI:10.1111/JOG.13249
AIMS — To compare physical activity patterns in pregnant 
women with and without GDM and to assess the effect of 
an exercise intervention on changes in physical activity 
patterns, blood glucose levels and pregnancy outcomes 
in women with GDM.
CONCLUSIONS — A low cost culturally appropriate model 
of care can bring about significant improvements in 
physical activity in women with GDM. The increases in 
physical activity are associated with improved glycaemic 
control and a reduction in adverse neonatal outcomes.

THE FRAMEWORK OF THE MODEL OF CARE
The WINGS MOC was developed targeting the indi-
vidual (pregnant women) their families, the health 
facility, community, and the global scientific audience.
 At the individual and family level, it aimed to 
build the awareness and education on GDM 
through one-on-one counselling, educational 
programs, and various educational materials. 
It also aimed to improve pregnancy outcomes
 At the health facility level, capacity building was 
done by training HCPs in identifying, treating, 
and managing GDM. A training curriculum was 
developed for this purpose
 At the larger community level, especially 
the remote and the rural regions which have 
limited access and
 Availability to GDM care, community health 
workers were trained with basic awareness 
and information about GDM. A separate 
training module was used for this purpose
 Global audience: The implementation of the 
model in India will help to provide insights and 
recommendations for improved care of women 
diagnosed with GDM in other low-resource 
settings. 
Through scientific publications, the model will be 
disseminated and made available to the global 
community.

MRS VEERAMMAL, DIAGNOSED WITH GDM AT THE SEVENTH MONTH OF HER THIRD PREGNANCY:
 My blood glucose levels were regularly monitored and they were normal 
until the diagnosis. At first I felt very sad. Nobody in my family has 
diabetes. So why me?
 
 I often felt tired, dizzy and not able to do my day to day activities. The 
Doctor told me that the blood sugar levels should be back to normal 
after delivery while in some cases they may continue to be high. 
Everyone around me was aware of my condition. But the mistake was mine. 
I was not able to follow proper diet during my pregnancy as I could not 
prepare food separately only for me.
Now I often feel very weak and tired due to my high blood sugar levels. I do 
regret for not following the Doctor’s advice from the beginning.

SUMMARY REPORT 
THE WAY FORWARD
Three independent external experts concluded 
that, the major strong point of the IDF WINGS Model 
of Care is that there was a strong follow up rate 
among postpartum women with GDM. This required 
intensive effort and perseverance and created an 
opportunity to prevent the development of Type 2 
Diabetes in these women. 
1 _ The local cultural practices of pregnant women after 
giving birth was a major challenge in getting women 
to attend follow up and postpartum screening 
 Local community sensitization on the useful-
ness of follow up and postpartum screening 
is extremely important
2 _ There was a strong need for refresher training 
sessions to ensure that new healthcare profes-
sionals were up to date
3 _ Future adaptations of the IDF Model of Care should 
attempt to implement it into rural areas
 The WINGS project came across difficulties 
in gaining permission from local state health 
authorities in piloting the Model of care in 
rural areas
 Consistent communication between IDF, MRDF 
and local health authorities was key in over-
coming this challenge
CONCLUSIONS
After implementation of the IDF Model of Care, women 
with GDM were found to have pregnancy outcomes 
comparable to women without GDM. These over-
whelming positive results suggest that the IDF 
Model of Care was successful in preventing adverse 
outcomes in women with GDM. The Model of Care 
was adapted for implementation in Low- to Middle – 
income countries and local conditions. It was designed 
to be scaled up in other countries worldwide and is 
suitable for integration into existing maternal and 
child health systems.
The WINGS Model of Care for GDM offers a compre-
hensive package of tools for every level of care which 
includes guides for health care professionals providing 
care for women diagnosed with GDM, community 
health workers who follow up women in remote areas 
having limited medical access and also to pregnant 
women with educational games to improve awareness 
on GDM. 
The full IDF GDM educational toolkit developed as 
part of the IDF Model of Care is available to down-
load for free on the IDF website: http://www.idf.org/
women-and-diabetes/resource-centre. 
Additionally, adapted questionnaires on physical 
activity and food frequency and a case report follow 
up form are also available. 
These outputs of the WINGS project represent the 
IDF strategy to tackle the rising prevalence of GDM in 
low – to middle- income countries. IDF are seeking 
financial and technical partners at both the interna-
tional and national level to disseminate the IDF Model 
of Care in Asia and Africa.
