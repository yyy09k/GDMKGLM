Diabetes is a complex, chronic condition
requiring continuous medical care with
multifactorial risk-reduction strategies be-
yond glucose management. Ongoing dia-
betes self-management education and
support are critical to empowering peo-
ple, preventing acute complications, and
reducing the risk of long-term complica-
tions. Signiﬁcant evidence exists that
supports a range of interventions to im-
prove diabetes outcomes.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
“Standards of Care in Diabetes,” referred
to here as the Standards of Care, is in-
tended to provide clinicians, researchers,
policy makers, and other interested indi-
viduals with the components of diabetes
care, general treatment goals, and tools
to evaluate the quality of care.
The ADA Professional Practice Com-
mittee (PPC) updates the Standards of
Care annually and strives to include dis-
cussion of emerging clinical considerations
in the text, and as evidence evolves, clini-
cal guidance is added to the recommen-
dations in the Standards of Care. The
Standards of Care is a “living” document
where important updates are published
online should the PPC determine that new
evidence or regulatory changes (e.g., drug
or technology approvals, label changes)
merit immediate inclusion. More informa-
tion on the “Living Standards” can be
found on the ADA professional website
DiabetesPro at professional.diabetes.org/
content-page/living-standards. The Stand-
ards of Care supersedes all previously
published ADA position statements—and
the recommendations therein—on clini-
cal topics within the purview of the
Standards of Care; while still containing
valuable analysis, ADA position state-
ments should not be considered the cur-
rent position of the ADA. The Standards
of Care receives annual review and ap-
proval by the ADA Board of Directors and
is reviewed by ADA staff and clinical lead-
ership. The Standards of Care also under-
goes external peer review annually.
SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES
The recommendations in the Standards
of Care include screening, diagnostic,
and therapeutic actions that are known
or believed to favorably affect health
outcomes of people with diabetes. They
also cover the prevention, screening, di-
agnosis, and management of diabetes-
associated complications and comorbid-
ities. The recommendations encompass
care throughout the lifespan, for youth
(children aged birth to 11 years and ado-
lescents aged 12–17 years), adults (aged
18–64 years), and older adults (aged
$65 years). The recommendations cover
the management of type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus,
and other types of diabetes.
The Standards of Care does not pro-
vide comprehensive treatment plans for
complications associated with diabetes,
such as diabetic retinopathy or diabetic
foot ulcers, but offers guidance on how
and when to screen for diabetes compli-
cations, management of complications
in the primary care and diabetes care
settings, and referral to specialists as
appropriate. Similarly, regarding the psy-
chosocial factors often associated with
diabetes and that can affect diabetes
care, the Standards of Care provides
guidance on how and when to screen,
management in the primary care and
The “Standards of Care in Diabetes,” formerly called “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes,” was originally approved in 1988. Most recent review/
revision: December 2022.

diabetes care settings, and referral but
does not provide comprehensive manage-
ment plans for conditions that require
specialized care, such as mental illness.
TARGET AUDIENCE
The target audience for the Standards of
Care includes primary care physicians, en-
docrinologists, nurse practitioners, physi-
cian
associates/assistants,
pharmacists,
dietitians, and diabetes care and education
specialists. The Standards of Care also pro-
vides guidance to specialists caring for peo-
ple with diabetes and its multitude of
complications, such as cardiologists, neph-
rologists, emergency physicians, internists,
pediatricians, psychologists, neurologists,
ophthalmologists, and podiatrists. Addi-
tionally, these recommendations help
payers, policy makers, researchers, re-
search funding organizations, and advo-
cacy groups to align their policies and
resources and deliver optimal care for
people living with diabetes.
The ADA strives to improve and up-
date the Standards of Care to ensure
that clinicians, health plans, and policy
makers can continue to rely on it as
the most authoritative source for cur-
rent guidelines for diabetes care. The
Standards of Care recommendations
are not intended to preclude clinical
judgment. They must be applied in the
context of excellent clinical care, with
adjustments for individual preferences,
comorbidities, and other patient factors.
For more detailed information about the
management of diabetes, please refer to
Medical Management of Type 1 Diabetes
(1) and Medical Management of Type 2
Diabetes (2).
METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURE
The Standards of Care includes discussion
of evidence and clinical practice recom-
mendations intended to optimize care for
people with diabetes by assisting pro-
viders and individuals in making shared
decisions about diabetes care. The recom-
mendations are informed by a systematic
review of evidence and an assessment of
the beneﬁts and risks of alternative care
options.
Professional Practice Committee
The PPC of the ADA is responsible for the
Standards of Care. The PPC is a multidisci-
plinary expert committee comprising physi-
cians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists,
diabetes care and education specialists,
registered dietitian nutritionists, behavioral
health scientists, and others who have ex-
pertise in a range of areas including but
not limited to adult/pediatric endocri-
nology, epidemiology, public health,
behavioral health, cardiovascular risk
management, microvascular complica-
tions, nephrology, neurology, ophthal-
mology, podiatry, clinical pharmacology,
preconception and pregnancy care, weight
management and diabetes prevention,
and use of technology in diabetes man-
agement. Appointment to the PPC is
based on excellence in clinical practice
and research, with attention to appropri-
ate representation of members based on
considerations including but not limited to
demographic, geographic, work setting, or
identity characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic-
ity, ability level). For the 2023 Standards of
Care, as in previous years, two representa-
tives from the American College of Cardi-
ology
(ACC)
acted
as
ad
hoc
PPC
members and reviewed and approved
Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and
Risk Management.” A PPC chairperson is
appointed by the ADA (currently N.A.E.) for
a 1-year term and oversees the committee.
Each section of the Standards of Care
is reviewed annually and updated with
the latest evidence-based recommenda-
tions by a PPC member designated as the
section lead as well as subcommittee
members. The subcommittees perform
systematic literature reviews and iden-
tify and summarize the scientiﬁc evi-
dence. An information specialist with
knowledge and experience in literature
searching (a librarian) is consulted as
necessary. A guideline methodologist
(R.R.B. for the 2023 Standards of Care)
with expertise and training in evidence-
based medicine and guideline develop-
ment methodology oversees all methodo-
logical aspects of the development of the
Standards of Care and serves as a statisti-
cal analyst.
Disclosure and Duality of Interest
Management
All members of the expert panel (the PPC
members, ad hoc members, and subject
matter experts) and ADA staff are re-
quired to comply with the ADA policy on
duality of interest, which requires disclo-
sure of any ﬁnancial, intellectual, or other
interests that might be construed as con-
stituting an actual, potential, or apparent
conﬂict, regardless of relevancy to the
guideline topic. For transparency, ADA re-
quires full disclosure of all relationships.
Full disclosure statements from all com-
mittee members are solicited and re-
viewed
during
the
appointment
process. Disclosures are then updated
throughout the guideline development
process (speciﬁcally before the start of
every meeting), and disclosure state-
ments are submitted by every Stand-
ards of Care author upon submission of
the revised Standards of Care section.
Members are required to disclose for a
time frame that includes 1 year prior to
initiation of the committee appoint-
ment process until publication of that
year’s Standards of Care. Potential dual-
ities of interest are evaluated by a des-
ignated review group and, if necessary,
the Legal Affairs Division of the ADA. The
duality of interest assessment is based
on the relative weight of the ﬁnancial re-
lationship (i.e., the monetary amount)
and the relevance of the relationship
(i.e., the degree to which an independent
observer might reasonably interpret an
association as related to the topic or rec-
ommendation of consideration). In addi-
tion, the ADA adheres to Section 7 of the
Council for Medical Specialty Societies
“Code for Interactions with Companies”
(3). The duality of interest review group
also ensures the majority of the PPC and
the PPC chair are without potential con-
ﬂict relevant to the subject area. Further-
more, the PPC chair is required to remain
unconﬂicted for 1 year after the publica-
tion of the Standards of Care. Members
of the committee who disclose a poten-
tial duality of interest pertinent to any
speciﬁc recommendation are prohibited
from participating in discussions related
to those recommendations. No expert
panel members were employees of any
pharmaceutical or medical device com-
pany during the development of the
2023 Standards of Care. Members of the
PPC, their employers, and their disclosed
potential dualities of interest are listed in
the section “Disclosures: Standards of
Medical Care in Diabetes—2023.” The
ADA funds the development of the Stand-
ards of Care from general revenue and
does not use industry support for this
purpose.
Evidence Review
The Standards of Care subcommittee for
each section creates an initial list of

relevant clinical questions that is reviewed
and discussed by the expert panel. In con-
sultation with a systematic review expert,
each subcommittee devises and executes
systematic literature searches. For the
2023 Standards of Care, PubMed, Med-
line, and EMBASE were searched for the
time periods of 1 June 2021 to 26 July
2022. Searches are limited to studies pub-
lished in English. Subcommittee members
also manually search journals, reference
lists of conference proceedings, and regu-
latory agency websites. All potentially rel-
evant citations are then subjected to a
full-text review. In consultation with the
methodologist, the subcommittees pre-
pare the evidence summaries and grading
for each section of the Standards of Care.
All PPC members discuss and review the
evidence summaries and make revisions
as appropriate. The ﬁnal evidence sum-
maries are then deliberated on by the
PPC, and the recommendations that will
appear in the Standards of Care are
drafted.
Grading of Evidence and
Recommendation Development
A grading system (Table 1) developed
by the ADA and modeled after existing
methods is used to clarify and codify
the evidence that forms the basis for
the recommendations in the Standards
of Care. All of the recommendations in
the Standards of Care are critical to
comprehensive care regardless of rating.
ADA recommendations are assigned rat-
ings of A, B, or C, depending on the qual-
ity of the evidence in support of the
recommendation. Expert opinion E is a
separate category for recommendations
in which there is no evidence from clinical
trials, clinical trials may be impractical, or
there is conﬂicting evidence. Recommen-
dations assigned an E level of evidence
are informed by key opinion leaders in
the ﬁeld of diabetes (members of the
PPC) and cover important elements of
clinical care. All Standards of Care recom-
mendations receive a rating for the
strength of the evidence and not for the
strength of the recommendation. Recom-
mendations with A-level evidence are
based on large, well-designed random-
ized controlled trials or well-done meta-
analyses of randomized controlled trials.
Generally, these recommendations have
the best chance of improving outcomes
when applied to the population for which
they are appropriate. Recommendations
with lower levels of evidence may be
equally important but are not as well
supported.
Of course, published evidence is only
one component of clinical decision-making.
Clinicians care for people, not populations;
guidelines must always be interpreted
with the individual person in mind. Indi-
vidual circumstances, such as comorbid
and coexisting diseases, age, education,
disability, and, above all, the values and
preferences of the person with diabetes,
must be considered and may lead to dif-
ferent treatment targets and strategies.
Furthermore, conventional evidence hier-
archies, such as the one adapted by the
ADA, may miss nuances important in dia-
betes care. For example, although there
is excellent evidence from clinical trials
supporting the importance of achieving
multiple risk factor control, the optimal
way to achieve this result is less clear. It
is difﬁcult to assess each component of
such a complex intervention.
In preparation of the 2023 Standards
of Care, the expert panel met for a 2-day
in-person/virtual meeting in Arlington,
Virginia, in July 2022, to present the evi-
dence summaries and to develop the rec-
ommendations. All PPC members participate
annually in updating the Standards of Care
and approve the recommendations therein.
Revision Process
Public comment is particularly impor-
tant in the development of clinical
practice recommendations; it promotes
transparency and provides key stake
holders the opportunity to identify and
address gaps in care. The ADA holds a
year-long public comment period re-
questing feedback on the Standards of
Care. The PPC reviews compiled feedback
from the public in preparation for the an-
nual update but considers more pressing
updates throughout the year, which may
be published as “living” Standards up-
dates. Feedback from the larger clinical
community and general public was in-
valuable for the revision of the Standards
of Care—2022. Readers who wish to
comment on the 2023 Standards of Care
are invited to do so at professional.
diabetes.org/SOC.
Feedback for the Standards of Care is
also obtained from external peer re-
viewers. The Standards of Care is re-
viewed by ADA clinical leadership and
scientiﬁc and medical staff and is ap-
proved by the ADA Board of Directors,
which includes health care professionals,
scientists, and lay people. The ACC per-
forms an independent external peer re-
view and the ACC Board of Directors
provides endorsement of Section 10,
“Cardiovascular and Metabolic Risk.” The

ADA adheres to the Council for Medical
Specialty Societies “Revised CMSS Prin-
ciples for Clinical Practice Guideline
Development” (4).
ADA STANDARDS, STATEMENTS,
REPORTS, AND REVIEWS
The ADA has been actively involved in
developing and disseminating diabetes
care clinical practice recommendations
and related documents for more than
30 years. The ADA Standards of Care is
an essential resource for health care pro-
fessionals caring for people with diabe-
tes. ADA Statements, Consensus Reports,
and Scientiﬁc Reviews support the rec-
ommendations included in the Standards
of Care.
Standards of Care
The annual Standards of Care supplement
to Diabetes Care contains the ofﬁcial ADA
position, is authored by the ADA, and
provides all of the ADA’s current clinical
practice recommendations.
ADA Statement
An ADA statement is an ofﬁcial ADA
point of view or belief that does not
contain clinical practice recommenda-
tions and may be issued on advocacy,
policy, economic, or medical issues re-
lated to diabetes. ADA statements un-
dergo a formal review process, including
a review by the appropriate ADA national
committee, ADA clinical leadership, sci-
ence and health care staff, and the ADA
Board of Directors.
Consensus Report
A consensus report on a particular topic
contains a comprehensive examination,
is authored by an expert panel (i.e., con-
sensus panel), and represents the panel’s
collective analysis, evaluation, and opin-
ion. The need for a consensus report
arises when clinicians, scientists, regula-
tors, and/or policy makers desire guidance
and/or clarity on a medical or scientiﬁc is-
sue related to diabetes for which the evi-
dence is contradictory, emerging, or
incomplete. Consensus reports may also
highlight evidence gaps and propose fu-
ture research areas to address these
gaps. A consensus report is not an ADA
position but represents expert opinion
only and is produced under the aus-
pices of the ADA by invited experts. A
consensus report may be developed af-
ter an ADA Clinical Conference or Re-
search Symposium.
Scientific Review
A scientiﬁc review is a balanced review
and analysis of the literature on a scien-
tiﬁc or medical topic related to diabetes.
A scientiﬁc review is not an ADA position
and does not contain clinical practice
recommendations but is produced under
the auspices of the ADA by invited ex-
perts. The scientiﬁc review may provide
a scientiﬁc rationale for clinical practice
recommendations in the Standards of
Care. The category may also include task
force and expert committee reports.
